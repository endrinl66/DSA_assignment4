# Assignment 4 – Stack-Based Expression Evaluation (Java)

**Course:** CSCI 2315  
**Semester:** Fall 2025  

## Overview
This assignment extends a provided stack-based codebase to add additional functionality using a menu-driven interface. The program works with fully parenthesized and post-fix expressions.

The starter files (`ListStack.java`, `ListNode.java`, and `StackDriver.java`) were provided on Canvas. Only `StackDriver.java` was modified, while existing methods such as `evaluateExpr` and `isLegal` were kept unchanged.

## Functionality
The program allows the user to:
- Enter and validate a fully parenthesized expression
- Evaluate a fully parenthesized expression
- Convert a fully parenthesized expression to post-fix notation
- Evaluate a post-fix expression (either converted or newly entered)
- Exit the program

The menu runs in an infinite loop and only terminates when the user selects **Quit**.

## Notes
- The stack implementation provided in the starter code is used as-is.
- No additional verification logic was added beyond what was required.
- This repository contains only the assignment solution files.
